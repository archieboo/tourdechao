I always say "leave things where you still want more". We took it by heart with our recent Galicia - Porto trip. We spent **only** 3 nights 4 days in the Rias Baixas region of Galicia and Porto: 3.5 days and 2 nights in Rais Baixas, 1.5 days and 1 night in Porto. Yes, it was short and sweet. 

## Getting there

Getting to Galicia from Chicago, you have two choices: fly into Santiago de Compostella airport, or Porto airport (of course, you have to connect via MAD or London, etc.) Particularly, we want to visit Rias Baixas, which is about similar distance driving from either airport (about 1.5 hours). Although we later found out that you can fly from MAD to Vigo, which is in Rias Baixas, and only 30 minutes from the hotel.
